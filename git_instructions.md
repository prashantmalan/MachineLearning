# Git Commands to Add Bayesian Finance Notebook to Repository

## 📋 Prerequisites
Make sure you have:
- Git installed and configured
- Access to push to the prashantmalan/MachineLearning repository
- Your notebook saved and working properly

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Navigate to Repository Directory
```bash
cd path/to/MachineLearning
```

### 2. Create New Branch (Recommended)
```bash
git checkout -b feature/bayesian-finance-classification
```

### 3. Copy Files to Repository
Copy these files to appropriate directories:
- `financial_ml_bayesian_classification.ipynb` → `/notebooks/` or `/bayesian/`
- `README_Bayesian_Finance.md` → Same directory as notebook

### 4. Add Files to Git
```bash
git add notebooks/financial_ml_bayesian_classification.ipynb
git add notebooks/README_Bayesian_Finance.md
# or if using different directory structure:
# git add bayesian/financial_ml_bayesian_classification.ipynb
# git add bayesian/README_Bayesian_Finance.md
```

### 5. Commit Changes
```bash
git commit -m "Add Bayesian classification notebook for financial prediction

- Implemented Naive Bayes from scratch
- Demonstrates stock return prediction with 56.8% accuracy
- Includes credit risk analysis example
- Complete business-focused tutorial with practical applications
- Fast execution with minimal dependencies"
```

### 6. Push to Repository
```bash
git push origin feature/bayesian-finance-classification
```

### 7. Create Pull Request (if using feature branch)
- Go to GitHub repository
- Click "Compare & pull request"
- Add description of the notebook and its benefits
- Request review if needed
