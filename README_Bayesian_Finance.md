# Bayesian Classification for Financial Prediction

## 📊 Overview
A comprehensive Jupyter notebook demonstrating Bayesian classification techniques applied to financial data. This notebook implements Naive Bayes from scratch and shows practical applications in stock return prediction and credit risk assessment.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn
- **Bayesian Statistics Fundamentals**: Understanding priors, likelihoods, and posteriors
- **Naive Bayes Implementation**: Complete from-scratch implementation with clear explanations
- **Financial Applications**: Stock return prediction and credit risk analysis
- **Performance Evaluation**: ROC curves, AUC, and business metrics
- **Practical Deployment**: Real-world considerations and best practices

## 📈 Key Results
- **Model Accuracy**: 56.8% (6.8% improvement over random selection)
- **Best Predictor**: Return on Equity (ROE) with 0.450 correlation
- **Execution Time**: Ultra-fast training and prediction (milliseconds)
- **Business Application**: Ready for portfolio screening and risk assessment

## 🏗️ Notebook Structure
1. **Setup & Data Generation**: Synthetic financial dataset creation
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizations and correlation analysis
3. **Bayesian Implementation**: Custom Naive Bayes classifier
4. **Model Training & Evaluation**: Performance metrics and interpretation
5. **Credit Risk Example**: Practical Bayesian probability calculations
6. **Business Applications**: Real-world deployment guidelines

## 📊 Dataset Features
- **15 stocks** × **36 months** = 540 observations
- **Features**: Market cap, P/B ratio, ROE, momentum
- **Target**: Binary classification (above/below median returns)
- **Split**: Chronological (70% train, 30% test)

## 🚀 Quick Start
```python
# 1. Run the notebook cells in order
# 2. All dependencies are built-in (numpy, pandas, matplotlib)
# 3. No external ML libraries required
# 4. Complete execution in under 2 seconds
```

## 📋 Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- No external ML dependencies required!

## 🎯 Business Applications
- **Portfolio Screening**: Initial stock filtering and ranking
- **Credit Scoring**: Fast risk assessment and approval decisions
- **Fraud Detection**: Real-time probability scoring
- **Risk Management**: Rapid classification of investment opportunities

## 📚 Key Concepts Covered
- **Bayes' Theorem**: P(Class|Features) = P(Features|Class) × P(Class) / P(Features)
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: Assuming normal distribution within each class
- **Feature Independence**: Understanding assumptions and limitations
- **Time-Series Considerations**: Chronological splits for financial data

## 💡 Best Practices Demonstrated
- ✅ Transform skewed financial variables (log transformation)
- ✅ Use chronological train/test splits for time series
- ✅ Interpret probabilities in business context
- ✅ Compare against meaningful baselines
- ✅ Focus on appropriate metrics (AUC for imbalanced classes)

## 🔄 Next Steps
This notebook serves as an excellent baseline for:
- Comparing against more complex models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Feature engineering experiments
- Real-world data integration
- Production deployment planning
